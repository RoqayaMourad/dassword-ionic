# Dassword üîê

The first Decentralized password manager, dassword.com

 

## Why centralized storage is bad for your sensitive data? üîëüìÑ
 
When you use a password manager or any other vault app, you store your data on a specific location (local or private cloud) this have some critical problems. your important data is centralized, meaning that  **whoever controls the location controls the content**. The controller can change the content, completely replace it, or just take it away. 
That makes your data vulnerable to attacks, exploitation, and loss. 

This makes centralized storage [local or remote] not optimal for storing important data, each has it's downsides

#### Storage

**Remote or Cloud**: Denied access to data or data deletion because of billing issues or even policy changes or what ever the service provider says, **You're completely reliant on who is holding your data**

**Local**: Vulnerable to hacks, MITM attacks or just accidental data lose



## But With Dassword your data is:

 - ‚úÖ **Secure**: and your master password never stored or transmitted.

 - ‚úÖ **Persistent**: Stored on the IPFS and Filecoin Network to ensure it's availability.

 - ‚úÖ **Provable Ownership**: Where you own your data the same way you own your FIL or bitcoin in your wallet, (wallet integration is coming soon).

 - ‚úÖ **Trustless**: Does not require you to trust the password manager company to know your data is safe.

 - ‚úÖ **Open source**: and open for anyone to study and analyze it's codebase.

## Technologies ? üî®

**Web3**: **IPFS** , **Filecoin**

**Front-end**  : Angular 14 

**Mobile**  : Ionic 6 with Capacitor

**Backend**  : Nodejs with PostgreSQL 14 ‚Äçüíª


## How it implements IPFS & Filecoin ?

- Backend as IPFS relay to store data to IPFS and retrieve it.

## What's next for Dassword ? 

There are few steps next to be market ready:
1. Adding general features.
2. Adding more security features:
	- Even more security layers, PGP E2EE encryption.
	- Salted login.
3. Cross-Platform Application:
	- iOS application.
